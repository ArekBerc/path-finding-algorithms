# A* algorithm 
A new approach to the A* alogrithm for optimizing the path and additionally, a visualization tool made by pygame. The algorithm used in this project gathered from  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334609254_A_Path-Planning_Performance_Comparison_of_RRT-AB_with_MEA_in_a_2-Dimensional_Environment. Also for determining the line of sight Bresenham's Algorithm is used.
